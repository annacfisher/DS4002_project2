## The below scripts relate to the EDA portion of our project, where we investigated different factors and variables within our dataset of extracted tweets.
## The order of such scripts with plots are: 
## 1) Time Series Line Chart of Adjusted Closing Price Over Time
## 2) Bar Chart of DraftKings Trading Volume Trends Over Time
## 3) Decomposition plot of the Log of Average Adjusted Weekly Price
## 4) Line Plot of First and Seasonal Difference of Log of Average Weekly Adjusted DraftKings Stock Price

## 1) Time Series Line Chart of Adjusted Closing Price Over Time
# Importing necessary libraries libraries: pandas for data handling, matplotlib and seaborn for visualization.
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Below, the code loads the dataset, converts the 'Date' column to a datetime format for proper time-series indexing, and sets 'Date' as index to facilitate time-series plotting.
data = pd.read_csv("/content/dkng_ts - dkng_ts.csv")
data['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(data['Date'])
data.set_index('Date', inplace=True)

# The below code generates a line chart to visualize the adjusted closing price of DraftKings stock over time.
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
plt.plot(data.index, data['DKNG.Adjusted'], color='green', linewidth=2, label="Adjusted Close")
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Adjusted Closing Price (US$)')
plt.title('Adjusted Closing Price Over Time')
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True, linestyle='--', alpha=0.6)

plt.show()
